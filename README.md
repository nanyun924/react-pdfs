> React renderer for creating PDF files

This project was created to show some concepts on a [talk](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Uruguay/events/234567399/), and it's purely experimental.

## Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf
cd react-pdf
npm install

# run example script
npm run example
```

Check out for the `example.pdf` file created on the root of the project

## Thanks
